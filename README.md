# APLYiD-Github

# Frontend Code Challenge

Create a frontend app to connect to Github API with the following features.

## #0 - Homepage `/`

* Simple but effective, use your imagination for a simple but catchy homepage with a button to start searching for users

## #1 - Search users `/users`

* Fill in an input from the app to search for a user
* Let users of the app sort by `followers`, `public_repos`, or `created_at` (sorted by `created_at` by default)

## #2 - Show user `/users/:id`

* When clicking a user from the list, the users details should be displayed
* It is up to you to display or not certain information, what you judge useful, links you want to put up or not etc...

# What to use and what not to use

* You have to connect to the API using axios or `fetch`, and NOT the official javascript client.
* You have to have routes in your App, routes are defined in each step title

# How do we evaluate?

You will be evaluated based on:

* **UX** 
* How you **solve some problems** you may run into
* What **tools**, patterns, or programming techniques you are using (OR which ones you are NOT using)
* There is no time limit to work on this, but have in mind the position can be filled if you take too long

# Cool to have

* The app deployed somewhere: Heroku, now, Github Pages, Amazon S3, Firebase, â€¦
* Why you choose the tools you are using or why you made that choice and not another one

# Final notes

We expect you to write the code based on what you have on your CV. If you say you are a senior developer we expect the code to be the most _state of art_ **as possible**.

You do not need to implement OAuth (bonus point if you do) and can just deal with unauthenticated request to the API with the throttle limit

We also expect you to use good tooling and approaches, don't forget your frontend **AND** your code will be evaluated.
